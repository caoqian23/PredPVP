# Introduction
predPVP is a stacking learning framework based on high-dimensional feature representation for identifying phage virion proteins. Firstly, the high-dimensional features extracted from the protein sequences are filtered using feature selection methods, then input into a two-layer stacking model for prediction.
# Usage
training_all feature.csv contains the original feature vectors.
Use Feature Selection.py for feature selection.
Use Stacking.py to train the stacking model to output the final prediction.
